            <p>Madhuri, the beloved elephant of Kolhapur, was recently relocated to Gujarat. We believe she belongs with
                her community in Nandani. Join us in our fight to bring her back home.</p>

            <h2>About Madhuri</h2>
            <img src="madhuri.png" alt="Madhuri the Elephant">
            <p>Madhuri, also known as Mahadevi, is a 36-year-old female elephant who has been a part of the Nandani
                village in Kolhapur for over 30 years. She was brought to the Jain math at the age of 3 and has since
                been a cherished member of the community.</p>
            <p>However, due to health concerns raised by PETA India, the Bombay High Court ordered her relocation to
                Vantara's facility in Jamnagar, Gujarat, for better care. Despite this, the people of Kolhapur want her
                back, citing her deep emotional and cultural significance.</p>

        <section id="campaign">
            <h2>The Campaign</h2>
            <p>The #bringbackmadhuri campaign has gained massive support, with over 100,000 signatures collected in just
                24 hours. Protests have been held, and even mobile network boycotts have been called in response to her
                relocation.</p>
            <p>Political leaders, including Maharashtra minister Prakash Abitkar and MPs Dhananjay Mahadik and
                Dhairyasheel Mane, are actively working to bring Madhuri back to Kolhapur.</p>
        </section>
        <section id="vantara">
            <h2>Vantara's Side</h2>
            <p>Vantara's Radhe Krishna Temple Elephant Welfare Trust in Jamnagar, Gujarat, is a state-of-the-art
                facility offering advanced care for elephants. They have assured that Madhuri is being well taken care
                of, with hydrotherapy and expert veterinary care.</p>
            <p>However, the people of Kolhapur argue that Madhuri's home is in Nandani, and she should be allowed to
                return.</p>
